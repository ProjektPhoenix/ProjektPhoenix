- 👀 I’m interested in climate mitigation and sustainability, especially in a business context and have been working in that area for 15+ years
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code at 42 Berlin, so mostly low level C programming, gradually expanding to a range of programming concepts and languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IT solutions to sustainability challenges
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: if it was feasible (time-wise) I would go anywhere by bicycle.
