- 👋 Hi, I’m @ProjektPhoenix
- 🌳 I have a long interest and history in climate mitigation and sustainability, especially in a business context. Key areas of expertise are carbon footprinting, sustainability standards and environmental policy applied to value chains.
- ⚡ As tech solutions are increasingly promoted (and scaled!?) while mitigation and sustainability solutions and the whole field in my opinion has remained in a dangeorus deadlock, I am currently going back to school to better understand and identify viable pathways that do potentially make use of scalable technology based solutions.
- 💻 I am learning to code at 42 Berlin, so mostly low level C and systems programming, gradually expanding to a range of programming concepts and languages.
- 👀 I am interested in collaborating on IT solutions to sustainability challenges.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his
- 🚵🏻‍♂️ Fun fact: if it was feasible (time-wise) I would go anywhere by bicycle, even for business trips.
